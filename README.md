## Project: Limită

Limită is an upcoming expense tracker and budget manager app designed to help users manage their
finances effectively. The app will provide tools to track income, expenses, and savings, allowing
users to set spending limits and make informed financial decisions.

## Current Status: Under Development (WIP)

While Limită is currently in its early stages, I'm actively working on building a robust foundation.
Once the app reaches a functional state, I'll provide detailed guidance, documentation, and coding
conventions to facilitate future development and contributions.
